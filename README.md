# Student Performance Dashboard

A data-driven interactive dashboard built using Streamlit to analyze and visualize student performance data.
The project helps in understanding how various academic and personal factors affect student outcomes using visual analytics and machine learning insights.
# Features

1.Interactive data visualizations

2.Performance analysis using real student data

3.Machine Learning model for performance prediction

4.CSV-based dataset handling

5.Web-based dashboard using Streamlit

# Tech Stack

1.Python

2.Streamlit – Web UI

3.Pandas – Data manipulation

4.NumPy – Numerical operations

5.Scikit-learn – Machine Learning

6.Joblib – Model serialization

7.Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

# Dataset

The dataset contains information related to student academics such as:

    Study hours

    Attendance

    Previous scores

    Other performance-related attributes

The data is used to:

    Analyze trends

    Visualize correlations

    Predict student performance

# Machine Learning Model

A trained ML model is included as:

    student_performance_model.joblib


The model is used to predict student performance based on input parameters.

Training and experimentation were done in a.ipynb.
